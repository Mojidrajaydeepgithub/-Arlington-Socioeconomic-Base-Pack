Arlington Socioeconomic Base Pack

This project builds a reproducible socioeconomic base pack for Arlington, Texas at the Census Tract level using only Python and public data sources - no GIS software required.
It combines data from the U.S. Census ACS 2023 5-Year Estimates, TIGER/Line tract geometries and OpenStreetMap (OSM) corridors.
